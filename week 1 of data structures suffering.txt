time complexity and stuff. the extra's are in the book like the drawings. 



data structures is managing data like a strucutre and need a massive storage. because data is a lot. 

first arrays:

array = [1,4,5,6,8,9] -> 1 line of arrays in python. 
def linearSearch(array, Target):
  i = 0
  matchIndex = -1 # null value because 0 in index is the 1st value
  while i <len(array) and matchIndex == -1:
    if array[i] == Target:
      matchIndex = i
    i = i + 1
  return matchIndex

arr = [3,6,8,9,1,9,10,45]
m = linearSearch(arr, 1)
print(m)

# this is linear search. 
# if we make it 11 of target, worst case scenario, it will output -1 because
# none will match 11, so matchIndex doesnt change.
